    "The list of instances can be imported from the file `problem_instances.json`, which contains a list of different instances of the problem with different sizes. You don't need to solve all of them, it is recommended to start testing your algorithms with the smaller ones and progresively moving to the larger ones, since the computational time needed to simulate them can also grow significantly. Additionally, it can be interesting to test your algorithms with different instances of the same size in order to get a better benchmark of their performance.\n",
