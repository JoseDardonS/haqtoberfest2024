    "In tensor networks it is necessary to perform truncations of the quantum states contained in MPS by decreasing the internal $\\chi$-dimension of the MPS. Different strategies are used to perform these truncations. The canonical truncation algorithm minimizes the introduced error, so it is very useful as a subroutine in many tensor network algorithms.\n",

    "To apply the canonical truncation algorithm it is necessary to convert the given MPS into an MPS in its canonical form. The transformation of an MPS into its canonical form is performed by converting each internal link of the MPS into a center of orthogonality. In order to complete this challenge we ask you to complete each of the following sections:\n",
