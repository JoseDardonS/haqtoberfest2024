    "In tensor networks it is necessary to perform truncations of the quantum states contained in MPS by decreasing the internal $\\chi$-dimension of the MPS. Different strategies are used to perform these truncations. The canonical truncation algorithm minimizes the introduced error, so it is very useful as a subroutine in many tensor network algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement the canonical truncation algorithm it is necessary to convert the given MPS to an MPS in its canonical form. The transformation of an MPS into its canonical form is carried out by converting each internal link of the MPS into a center of orthogonality.\n",

It is also requested to compare for the different local methods which one introduces less error with respect to the canonical truncation algorithm, as shown in the following figure.\n",
