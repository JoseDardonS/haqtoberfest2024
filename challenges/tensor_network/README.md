# <center> **Tensor Networks Challenge**


The tensor networks challenge consists of two tasks to be performed that are independent of each other. 

- The first challenge consists in the implementation of MPS truncation algorithms. 
- The second task consists of implementing a sampling algorithm which allows to obtain probability distributions of quantum states contained in MPS.
