## Hello quantum coders!

First of all, thank you for choosing the Quantum Finance challenge, hope you eenjoy it! At the time you are reading this document, we haven't met yet, but will hit the office in a matter of minutes. My name is Adri√†, nice to meet you guys! I'm sure Ameer, Isi and the rest of mentors have given you a warm welcome :). 

As Ameer already commented during the presentation, this challenge consists of tackling a very well-known problem in the financial industry, Portfolio Optimization, leveraging Quantum Machine Learning techniques. 

## Structure and recommendations on how to approach this challenge

The goal of this challenge is to build your own Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) for Portfolio Optimization. As this may be quite challenging, the idea is to try to reproduce the results I obtained during my Bachelor's Thesis, which should have been already forwarded to you. My first recommendation is that before starting to type a single line of code, you read the article in diagonal up to section V (included). I wouldn't devote more than an hour to this, having a general idea is enough, take into account you can ask as many questions as needed. This way, you'll have a clear idea of what we want to achieve, which will be very helpful for the coding part. 

Note that there are two folders: challenge and solved. In the latter, you'll find a valid solution for reaching the first and main milestone of this challenge: building a VQE for Portfolio Optimization. In the former, you'll find the same notebook, but the code of the functions has been deleted. My main intention is that you learn about quantum computing and Finance, so I proposed an approach to follow in case you feel overwhelmed. You don't need to follow the established path, although we have also a non-guided part of the challenge for you. 

The deliverable of this hackathon is the notebook `challenge/challenge.ipynb`. You'll see that there are a lot of
